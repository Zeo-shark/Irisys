## Challenge Details

***Problem Statement***  

The use case is as such : That you are given a task to count the number of people in a shopping mall

***Problem Dimensions***

This problem has following dimensions

Use triangulation or any other algorithm to count number of people in a shopping mall.
State the margin of error or confidence interval of the output.
Since the count of people is a function of time, solution should be such that it takes continuous video feed and give count of people.
IE.g.In a shopping mall with 5 adjacent shops, can the solution give count of people in each shop and aggregate it at the mall level in a live scenario where there is a continuous camera feed in each shop and the corridor.
State assumptions used.
